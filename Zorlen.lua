  4.27
		Fixed the lag in german game clients!
 
  4.26
		Functions from other classes that can not be used will no longer be loaded into memory if you are not playing on that class.
		Added an option in the options window to turn off the Auto Mob Immunity Detection.
 
  4.25
		Converted all the localization into an array for more versatility. This means that most of the LOCALIZATION_ZORLEN_SpellName will now be LOCALIZATION_ZORLEN.SpellName
		Added an option in the options window to clear the Immune Mob Database.
		Set it so that it will not detect a mob as immune if they are in combat but have no target. This is to try to prevent mobs that are banished or have some other immune spell that makes them not target anyone from being detected as immune. This will cause some real immunitys to not be detected at first, but not very often since you only need it to log the immunity once.
 
  4.24
		Fixed the nasty lock up bug.
 
  4.23
		Zorlen will now keep track of mob immunity to spells and abilitys. -- You can set a mob to ignore this list in the Zorlen options window.
		I have hopefully fixed the problems that some german clients had been having.
 
  4.22
		Added a GUI Options Window. To open it you may use the slash command:
		/zorlen
		or
		/zf
 
  4.20
		Added a Version History text file in the addon folders.
		Added slash command to help with localization translation: /zorlen log
		You may now add a file named MyFunctions.lua to the Zorlen folder that may contain your own custom functions that you may have.

		A few small bug fixes.
		You can now use this slash command to add some pre made macros to your hunter or warlock  specific macro lists:
		/zorlen macros
		You must be on a hunter or warlock for them to be added.
		This slash command has been made to not replace any macros even if they have the same name. If you ever need to restore one of the macros then just delete that macro and run the slash command.
  
  4.10
		Hooked casting functions to get spell information
		Will now be able to also use spell information such as spell name and rank from spells that are cast outside of a macro
		The casting and channeling detection functions will now be able to work for all spells and macros that are not from the zorlen library

		Significantly reduced the lag caused when the action bar buttons are being scanned
